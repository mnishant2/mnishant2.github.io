      <title>Incremental Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was directed towards the final course project requirement for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/comp-550&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;COMP 550: Natural Language Processing&lt;/a&gt;

 course at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge graphs (KGs) succinctly represent
real-world facts as multi-relational graphs. A
plethora of work exists in embedding the information
in KG to a continuous vector space in
order to obtain new facts and facilitate multiple
down-stream NLP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity
of the KG embedding problem, to the
best of our knowledge, we find that no existing
work handles dynamic/evolving knowledge
graphs that incorporates facts about new
entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we propose this problem
as an incremental learning problem and
propose solutions to obtain representations for
new entities and also update the representations
of old entities that share facts with these
newer entities. The primary motive of this setup is to avoid
relearning the knowledge graph embedding altogether
with the occurrence of every new set
of facts (triplets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build our solutions with

&lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5071-translating-embeddings-for-modeling-multi-relational-data.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TransE(Bordes et al.)&lt;/a&gt;

 as our base KG embedding model and
evaluate the learned embeddings on facts associated
with these new entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we formulated
two solutions; the first approach followed a finetuning
based transfer-learning solution, and the
second followed a model-agnostic meta-learning
based approach with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN). While our model-specific finetuning
approach fared well, the proposed model independent
approach failed to learn representations for a new entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OpenKE’s&lt;/a&gt;

 implementation for setting our model. For our
task, we made changes to the TransE model, so
that it can learn the representations of the new entities. We employed the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52312&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FB20K&lt;/a&gt;

 dataset
(

) for our task. In addition to
containing all the entities and relations from the
FB15K dataset, this dataset also contains new entities
which was required for our setup. We evaluate the models for link prediction, which
aims to predict the missing h or t for a relation fact
(h, r, t).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reddit Comment Classification [Kaggle]</title>
      <link>https://mnishant2.github.io/project/reddit_comment/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 14:11:20 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mnishant2.github.io/project/reddit_comment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/reddit-comment-classification-comp-551&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;competition hosted on Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;

 and was a miniproject for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;

 Course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyze text from the website Reddit, and develop a multilabel
classification model to predict which subreddit (group) a
queried comment came from. Reddit is an online forum, where
people discuss various topics from sports to cartoons, technology
and video-games. The dataset is a list of comments from 20
different subreddits (groups/topics). This problem can be formulated
as a type of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sentiment analysis&lt;/a&gt;

 problem, which is quite
well-known in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
Sentiment analysis is a computational approach toward
identifying opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this dataset, we implemented a Bernoulli Naive Bayes
classifier, trained and tested it against the dataset. We also analyzed
various models for improving the classification accuracy,
including Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression,
k-Nearest Neighbours, the Ensemble method of Stacking and
a Deep Learning model 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ULMFiT (J.Howard and S.Ruder,
2018)&lt;/a&gt;

. We also tried using the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flairNLP/flair&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FlairNLP library&lt;/a&gt;

 concatenating several combinations of embeddings such as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://alanakbik.github.io/papers/coling2018.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FlairEmbeddings&lt;/a&gt;

+
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt;

 to get text features for classification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compare the accuracy of these models for different Feature
extraction methods, namely 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tfidf.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Term Frequency-Inverse document
frequency (TF-IDF)&lt;/a&gt;

, Binary and Non-Binary Count Vectorizer.
We also analyze the performance gain/loss after applying
Dimensionality reduction methods on the dataset. In particular,
we explore the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis#:~:text=Principal%20component%20analysis%20%28PCA%29%20is,components%20and%20ignoring%20the%20rest.&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Principle Component Analysis (PCA)&lt;/a&gt;

 inspired
method of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/latent-semantic-analysis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that the best results were obtained by stacking various combinations
of the models described above. For the final submission, we
used an ensemble classifier with ’soft’ voting by Stacking SVM,
Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression at their optimum parameter
settings.which gave an accuracy of 57.97% on our validation
data and 58.011% on kaggle public leaderboard. Adding ULMFit
to the stack and using a logistic regression on top as meta
classifier further bolstered the accuracy to 60.1%. We finished

      <title>Generic Extraction Module (G.E.M)</title>
      <link>https://mnishant2.github.io/project/gem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project at Signzy involved training a generalizable model for information retrieval from OCR output of Indian ID cards. We used both character level embeddings and word level embeddings(
&lt;a href=&#34;https://allennlp.org/elmo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ELMO&lt;/a&gt;

) in a stacked manner for language modelling before passing the concatenated embeddings to a bidirectional Long Short Term Memory neural network with Conditional Random Field modelling on LSTM output (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01991&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Huang et al.&lt;/a&gt;

) for final classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model was trained on a large corpus of text OCR outputs obtained from our own proprietary ID cards dataset for extracting non-trivial information such as Names, dates, numbers, addreses from any card. The training was done in a way to ensure the embeddings were also fine tuned. The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flairNLP/flair&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FlairNLP library&lt;/a&gt;

 was used to create the preprocessing, text embedding, training and postprocessing pipeline and training was performed using pytorch framework. Multiple combinations of embeddings including FlairEmbeddings(
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Contextualized string embeddings for sequence labelling&lt;/a&gt;

), BERT, CharacterEmbeddings, ELMO, XLNet were benchmarked before settling on the final pair based on accuracy, compute and efficiency considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the model perform admirably well on unseen text from ID types part of training data irrespective of variations in OCR output and image layout, but it generalised well for out of sample ID types too when finetuned with just 1-5 samples of these cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this was to build a generic, flexible information retrieval engine thats pretrained to extract important information from OCR output of all ID cards without specifically being trained on them or having seen them, without any rule based processing, that can be easily finetuned on a very small number of samples of any new card type for optimum performance. This was made into a rest API as a plug and play product for clients to finetune the model on their samples and then use it out of the box to extract information from IDs. The performance was measured using precision and recall figures.&lt;/p&gt;
