      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was directed towards the final course project requirement for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/comp-550&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;COMP 550: Natural Language Processing&lt;/a&gt;

 course at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge graphs (KGs) succinctly represent
real-world facts as multi-relational graphs. A
plethora of work exists in embedding the information
in KG to a continuous vector space in
order to obtain new facts and facilitate multiple
down-stream NLP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity
of the KG embedding problem, to the
best of our knowledge, we find that no existing
work handles dynamic/evolving knowledge
graphs that incorporates facts about new
entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we propose this problem
as an incremental learning problem and
propose solutions to obtain representations for
new entities and also update the representations
of old entities that share facts with these
newer entities. The primary motive of this setup is to avoid
relearning the knowledge graph embedding altogether
with the occurrence of every new set
of facts (triplets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build our solutions with

&lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5071-translating-embeddings-for-modeling-multi-relational-data.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TransE(Bordes et al.)&lt;/a&gt;

 as our base KG embedding model and
evaluate the learned embeddings on facts associated
with these new entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we formulated
two solutions; the first approach followed a finetuning
based transfer-learning solution, and the
second followed a model-agnostic meta-learning
based approach with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN). While our model-specific finetuning
approach fared well, the proposed model independent
approach failed to learn representations for a new entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OpenKE’s&lt;/a&gt;

 implementation for setting our model. For our
task, we made changes to the TransE model, so
that it can learn the representations of the new entities. We employed the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52312&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FB20K&lt;/a&gt;

 dataset
(
&lt;a href=&#34;http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/publications/aaai2016_dkrl.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Xie et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;

) for our task. In addition to
containing all the entities and relations from the
FB15K dataset, this dataset also contains new entities
which was required for our setup. We evaluate the models for link prediction, which
aims to predict the missing h or t for a relation fact
(h, r, t).&lt;/p&gt;
