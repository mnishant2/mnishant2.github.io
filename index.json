[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Hey!! I am currently pursuing my Masters at the School of Computer Science at McGill University. I am also working as a Graduate Research Assistant in collaboration with Center for Intelligent Machines and Department of Diagnostic Radiology.\nI completed my Bachelors from Birla Institute of Technology, India  in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Previously, I have worked as a developer in the AI team of a fintech startup in India Signzy. My interests primarily lie in the domain of Deep Learning, specifically its applications to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. Currently, I am working on Deep Learning for Digital Histopathology as part of my Master's thesis. It largely involves using sparse approximation based unsupervised instance segmentation in Whole Slide Images and cross modal feature representation learning from both Histopathology and Radiology data for classification tasks.\nIn the past I have worked on a range of projects as part of coursework, internships and job encompassing diverse tasks in areas of Machine Learning like Face Detection, Optical Character Recognition, Information Retrieval from text, Activity Recognition, Image forensics, Speech Recognition among others.\nI intend to pursue a career in AI research, academic or industrial, in order to push the state of the art in this field and solve the contemporary set of real world problems.
